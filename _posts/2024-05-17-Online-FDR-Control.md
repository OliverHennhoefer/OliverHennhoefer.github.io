## Abstract

This article summarizes the paper
[***Conformal k-NN Anomaly Detector for Univariate Data Streams***](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v60/ishimtsev17a/ishimtsev17a.pdf).

>Anomalies in time-series data give essential and often actionable information in many applications.
**In this paper we consider a model-free anomaly detection method for univariate time-series which
adapts to non-stationarity in the data stream and provides probabilistic abnormality scores based
on the conformal prediction paradigm**. Despite its simplicity the method performs on par with
complex prediction-based models on the Numenta Anomaly Detection benchmark and the Yahoo!
S5 dataset.
