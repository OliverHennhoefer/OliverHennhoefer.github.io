## Abstract

This article summarizes the paper
[***Conformalized Density- and Distance-based Anomaly
Detection in Time-Series Data***](https://www.academia.edu/29261761/Conformalized_density_and_distance_based_anomaly_detection_in_time_series_data).

>Anomalies (unusual patterns) in time-series data give essential, and often actionable information in critical
situations. Examples can be found in such fields as healthcare, intrusion detection, finance, security and flight
safety. In this paper we propose new conformalized density- and distance-based anomaly detection algorithms
for a one-dimensional time-series data. The algorithms use a combination of a feature extraction method, an
approach to assess a score whether a new observation differs significantly from a previously observed data,
and a probabilistic interpretation of this score based on the conformal paradigm.
