<!---## Abstract

This article summarizes the paper
[***Conformal k-NN Anomaly Detector for Univariate Data Streams***](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v60/ishimtsev17a/ishimtsev17a.pdf).

>Anomalies in time-series data give essential and often actionable information in many applications.
**In this paper we consider a model-free anomaly detection method for univariate time-series which
adapts to non-stationarity in the data stream and provides probabilistic abnormality scores based
on the conformal prediction paradigm**. Despite its simplicity the method performs on par with
complex prediction-based models on the Numenta Anomaly Detection benchmark and the Yahoo!
S5 dataset.

## Conformal Anomaly Detection

The algorithm described in the paper is based on the principles of [Conformal Anomaly Detection](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:690997/FULLTEXT02.pdf)
(CAD) &ndash; a distribution-free (_non-parametric_) and model-agnostic approach for uncertainty-quantified anomaly detection. 
CAD works with every method returning _anomaly scores_ (the _non-conformity measure_) and seeks to turn them into statistically valid empirical _p_-values.
Respective _p_-values are obtained by comparing observed anomaly scores to a set of reference values (the _calibration set_)
known to stem from _non-anomalous_ training data (_see_ [One-Class Classifcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-class_classification)).
With that, the _p_-values are calculated as the number of _calibration values_ that are _more extreme_
(typically larger) than an anomaly score as obtained on test data (typically adjusted by $\frac{nx+1}{x+1}$, to ensure the _super-uniform_ nature of obtained _p_-values).
The intuition behind is that observations that do not _conform_ to the calibration set are likely to be anomalous, thus yielding
lower _p_-values as they tend to be more extreme than the reference values from normal data (the _numerator_ gets smaller).
The underlying principles hold under the assumption of [_exchangability_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_random_variables#:~:text=The%20property%20of%20exchangeability%20is,underlying%20distributional%20form%2C%20is%20exchangeable.)
(related to _iid_) the resulting value can be treated as an empirical _p_-value.

## CAD _k_-NN

**_CAD-KNN_** as proposed in the paper is designed to apply the principles of CAD to a **_univariate online setting_** in a streaming context. 
In [Shafer and Vovk, 2008](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/shafer08a/shafer08a.pdf) it was previously demonstrated that the
overarching principles of _conformal inference_ (see
[_conformal prediction_](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~angelopoulos/publications/downloads/gentle_intro_conformal_dfuq.pdf))
also apply in an _online setting_.
